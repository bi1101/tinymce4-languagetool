      <p>There are many people who enroll to university for academic study, while others prefer to work as electrician
        or plumbers due to the shortage of qualified labor power. I consider that this is an incorrect statement because
        all professions demand some specific skills and knowledge.</p>
      <p>

        Firstly, people have to gain quite a wide number of skills for their occupation; therefore they are forced at
        first go to university to obtain some theoretical knowledge in a particular area. For instance, to become a
        professional manager or a bank worker, person should learn a significant amount of subjects which are related to
        this profession, such as accounting, finance, pricing, tax policy and so on. Of course, when you go to the bank,
        or hire a new employee, you want that this person will be well-educated and qualified, although in addition,
        this person also must have some experience related with a particular area. Nevertheless, before practice, a
        person should obtain some knowledge because no one will give a job to uneducated man.</p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, some professions are not so requireable and demand much less knowledge to start working. For
        example, it can be a cashier or a barista, these professions do not require some serious and deep proficiency in
        this field, so eventally people only have to gain some limited and necessary skills for working. This is a good
        opprtunity for students to earn their first money which can be used in developing and education as well.</p>
      <p>
        In the end, I would like to conclude that people should go to university studying a wide range of subjects in
        order to get knowledge and be prepared for a job, however there are also some professions which is much easier
        and simplier and can use inexperienced people to work</p>
